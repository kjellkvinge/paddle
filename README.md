Paddle
======

Simple script to use for simple lottery.

Random numbers will be drawn and showed on screen. The last number is the winner.

Press mousebutton again for next lottery.

Example: http://kjellkvinge.github.io/paddle/html/paddle.html

The original goal was to make a simple html file which could work
as a local copy. There was no network where the lottery was taking place.
So, just rightclick on the example link and download the HTML file, then
you have everything you need.

Any feedback is appreciated
